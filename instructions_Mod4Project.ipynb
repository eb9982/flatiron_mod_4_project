    "In module 4, we covered unsupervised learning, time series and deep learning. We'll have a presentation in class on where you will be presenting to your fellow Data Scientists!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project must be focused on one of the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Series\n",
    "- Recommendation Systems\n",
    "- Clustering\n",
    "- Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "- Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "#### Mod 4 Project Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem Statement\n",
    "- A description of the problem at hand. What problem are you trying to solve? Why is it a problem?\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics of your models and an explanation of which model is best for your given domain\n",
    "- A description/visual representation of your data preparation and modeling pipeline \n",
    "- At least 3 visualizations\n",
    "- Conclusion\n",
    "- So what? Given your analysis, what do we now know about our initial problem statement?\n",
    "- Your final product should be either a slide, a jupyter notebook, or a readme.md file \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Gathering\n",
    "Data can be captured from current databases online or scraped. If performing a classification, you should have at least 1000 observations belonging to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "Some useful sources of data for Deep Learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- http://www.image-net.org/\n",
    "- http://deeplearning.net/datasets/\n",
    "- https://skymind.ai/wiki/open-datasets\n",
